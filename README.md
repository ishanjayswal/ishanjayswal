Ishan Jayswal - AI/ML Engineer
Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ishan Jayswal, a dedicated AI/ML engineer passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to tackle complex problems and drive innovation.

About Me
I am a self-motivated individual with a strong background in computer science and a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey in this field began with a fascination for the potential of data to reveal insights and make intelligent decisions. Since then, I have immersed myself in learning and applying various AI and ML techniques to diverse domains, from computer vision and natural language processing to predictive analytics and reinforcement learning.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

Credit Card Fraud Detection
Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Pandas
Description: The aim of the project is to use data driven insights to create a machine learning model for fraud detection amongst credit card transactions. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

NLP with Disaster Tweets of Twitter Data
Technologies used: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn
Description: Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, itâ€™s not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are actually announcing a disaster. It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and sentiment polarity prediction.
